Ra: Dependency Injection in swift

From [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra): 

>All forms of life were believed to have been created by Ra, who called each of them into existence by speaking their secret names. Alternatively humans were created from Ra's tears and sweat, hence the Egyptians call themselves the "Cattle of Ra."
